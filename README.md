## Video Walkthrough of the Timer:
- [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J06ehmdAYpRw4-F1YVJsafYBqdFDH4oO/view?usp=sharing): This is a short walkthrough of how the timer behaves and the functionalities that it supports.

## Highlights/Structure of the Project
- The label in the center of the screen shows the current timer value including seconds and milliseconds
- Two buttons towards the bottom of the screen allow to Start or pause and Stop the timer.
- The timer label is surrounded by an animated ring with a shadow.
- The timer continues to function in the background when the user suspends the app and calculates the remaining time accordingly when the app becomes active again.
- The properties and logic of the timer comes from the `TimerViewModel`
- The App sends a notification to the user when the timer is completed.
